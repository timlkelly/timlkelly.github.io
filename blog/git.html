        I'm nearly through my first week of phase0 at dev boot camp.  After taking care of all the setup and logistics we were introduced to version control.  Version control is a way of keeping detailed copies of your work.  While it isn't a new concept to me, I have never used a system to this caliber.  In the most simple form version control lets you save copies of your work that you can revert back to if needed.  Though that isn't all it does.  Version control also simplifies collaboration and group work when working on and sharing the same project.
      </p>

        There are a lot of different version control systems available but for this program we're using Git.  Git is a popular and free option for version control. Git allows you to add messages to each of your commits, or saves.  This is a great feature because it let's me leave notes about all of the changes I've made to a project. I can only imagine how helpful this will be throughout dev boot camp.

        I'll be using a website called GitHub where I can store and backup my work. GitHub is more than just a remote server for backups though.  It is a huge online community where you can share and collaborate with others on projects. I've used it in the past to find other people's work but it'll be great to now be able to submit my own as well.
