      <h2>Javascript</h2>

      <p>
        This last week was spent learning Javascript.  Coming from studying Ruby for the last several
        weeks, the two share a lot of similarities but definitely have their differences.  And as Ruby
        was the first language to be taught, I tend to reference back to Ruby when trying to learn or associate
        new Javascript aspects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both languages have two ways to store data and while similar they're both different.  The first
        being arrays.  Ruby's second data container is a hash while Javascript has objects.  They both 
        hold data attached to custom specific keys, or properties and can consist of many different types
        of objects.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The largest difference between the two that I have found is that a Ruby hash is an instance of a
        the class Hash while an object in Javascript is a prototype. In object-oriented programming
        inheritance can be performed through classes or prototypes. Objects can look to their prototype
        for properties that they themselves do not have just as instances of a new class can call methods
        that they inherited from their parent class in Ruby.
