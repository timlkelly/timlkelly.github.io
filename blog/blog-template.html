<!-- 
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

Helpful.  It was great to have another mind viewing the same problem. We can cover more that way.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Yes.  It is much easier to write html when you have a drawing of what it should look like.  If I tried to write the html just from my head I think I would have kept reworking my ideas and wasting time.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

A wireframe needs to have the right amount of detail.  Showing the different elements and layout of a site but not too much depth as it is stll early in the development process.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

We researched and used header, nav, section, and footer.
