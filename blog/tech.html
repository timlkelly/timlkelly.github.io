      <h2>Regular Expressions</h2>
      1.30.2016
      <br>
      <p>
        Regular expressions, also know as regexp or regex, is a sequence of characters that is used to define a search pattern.  They are mainly used for searching through strings by pattern matching. In Ruby the regex constructor is <code>//</code>. This is an empty expression but the pattern would go in between the forward slashes. The method <code>match</code> can be used to detect matches in a string. <code>Match</code> is both a regex and string method so it can be used either way.

        <pre>puts "Match!" if /cat/.match("There's a cat in this string!")<br>puts "Match!" if "There's a cat in this string!".match(/cat/)</pre>

        Ruby also provides a regex operator: <code>=~</code>. 

        <pre>puts "Match!"if "There's a cat in this string!" =~ /cat/</pre>

        Though the <code>=~</code> operator will return the numerical index of the character in the string where the match started.  <code>Match</code> will return an instance of the class <code>MatchData:</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some additional regular expression search parameters.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>.</code> is the wild card character <code>c.t</code> would match "cat"
      </p>
      <p>
        Square brackets <code>[]</code> can be used can be used to match a single character or through a range. <code>[cat]</code> would match the characters "c", "a", and "t". <code>[a-g]</code> would match any lower case character a through g. <code>[cb]at</code> would match "cat" and "bat".
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>[^ ]</code> matches a single character that is not inside of the brackets. <code>[^cat]</code> will match any character other than "c", "a", or "t".
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>^</code> before the pattern will match if the starting position or line of the string begins with that pattern.
        <code>$</code>is the opposite of <code>^</code>. It looks for matches at the end of the string
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>/^cat/.match("Hello cat")</code> would not match cat but <code>/$cat/.match("Hello cat")</code>would.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>()</code> allows for submatches or subexpressions. These can later be recalled with <code>$n</code> where n refers to the subexpression that was set. If you were to use a regular expression with multiple subexpressions you could recall the first one with <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code> would recall the second subexpression and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>{}</code> specifies exactly how many repetitions of the pattern to match by providing a number inside the curly braces directly after the expression to be matched. <code>/\d{3}/</code> will match exactly three digits. Ranges can be specified like so <code>{3,7}</code> which would return any matches between three to seven and lastly <code>{3,}</code> results in three or more.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>*</code> and <code>+</code> are the zero or more and one or more quantifiers, respectively.  They will return as much of the string as they possibly can.  Adding a <code>?</code> after either quantifier will make them stop at the end of the first match.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regular expressions seem like powerful tools but they can easily become overwhelming to decipher. What do you imagine <code>\b(\w)?(\w)\w?\2\1</code> does? Or how about <code>\b\d{3}[-.]?\d{3}[-.]?\d{4}\b</code>? Well the first one will return two to five letter palindromes and the second returns phone numbers that use hyphons, periods or do not contain a spacer. As with anything, I'm sure you can read these faster as you use regex more and more, however it does provide for a rather steep learning curve.
