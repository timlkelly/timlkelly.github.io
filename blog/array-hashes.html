      <h2>Arrays and Hashes</h2>
      1.3.2016
      <br>
      <p>
      Ruby uses Arrays and Hashes to store collections of objects. Objects include strings, integers, arrays,
      hashes, nil, true, false, etc.  While they both fundamentally do the same thing, they do so in different
      ways. Before we get into their differences let's look at some more similarities.
      </p>  
      <p>
      As noted above, they both store a collection of objects. Additionally, arrays and hashes both share a lot
      of similar notation.  To create a new array you 
      could use either:<pre>Array.new<br>array = []</pre> And as you can imagine Hashes can be created like so:
      <pre>Hash.new<br>hash = {}</pre> You may have noticed that arrays use square brackets <code>[]</code> while 
      hashes use curly brackets <code>{}</code>
      </p>
      <p>
      Now that the Array and Hash exist, we can add data to them.
      <pre>array[0] = 72<br>hash = ["key"] = "value"</pre>
      Here is where we start to get to their differences.  Both store data which can be accessed through an 
      index. Arrays use an integer index. In the example above we are setting the 0-th spot of the array to 72. 
      Hashes use a key/value pair. The key can be anything as long as it is unique and it will be assigned to a
      specific value.  Arrays also remember the order in which objects were entered into them. Hashes now also
      remember the order of insertion (thanks to Ruby 1.9!) though they previous did not.
      </p>
      <p>
      The two seem pretty similar, so when do you use which?  If your data needs a specific label, a hash is the
      best answer. This way you can customize the keys to all of the data. Otherwise you could use an array. If 
      order is important you can use an array.  Yes, hashes now too keep order in mind but it seems that
      arrays are usually used to store ordered information. Lastly, arrays are good for queue or stack structure.
