        Phase 1 starts tomorrow. I'm still not sure what to expect though I'm pretty sure
        this will be different from anything I know so far. Creating and maintaining a 
        blog over the last nine weeks has been an interesting process.  It's taught me
        a lot from a technical point of view between HTML and CSS. I've never been one
        to write down my reflections and in that sense it has made me think and approach
        a lot of this topics differently. I'm looking forward to cleaning this site up,
        adding more content and hope to continue blogging through the next three phases.
