      <h2>CSS Concepts</h2>

        Of all of the CSS concepts I covered this week, positioning stands out to me as one of the most important.  It completely determines the positioning and layout of your website and if it isn't quite correct the entire thing can look wrong.  There are four position values: static, relative, absolute, and fixed.  Static is the standard.  This is how the elements would normally be placed on the page by the Document Object Model (DOM).  Relative, as it sounds, is a position reflected from where the element would normally be placed.  It can specifically moved around from the first location with properties such as top, bottom, left and right.  Absolute, a variation of relative, allows the developer to position the element in one specific spot on the page. However it is important to note that these values are relative to its parent element.  Finally, fixed holds an element in place on the document.  The element will stay exactly there even when the user scrolls up or down through the web page.
