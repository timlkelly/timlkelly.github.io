      <h2>Ruby Classes</h2>

      <br>
      <p>
        When working with objects that share similar characteristics but are different from each other, classes can offer 
        simplicity and organization.  Classes can hold a number of variables and methods that are specific to that class 
        object.  Let's make a class to keep track of all of the books in your library! We start by defining our new class 
        and what it should do when we make an instance of one. We can also define the title and author when we create a new
        book.  Classes use both local and instance variables.  Local variables, as their name suggests, are limited to the 
        method they're a part of.  Instance variables however are available to the entire instance or specific object of 
        that class.  Instance variables are denoted with the @ symbol. 
        <pre>class Books <br> def initialize(title, author) <br>  @title = title <br>  @author = author <br> end <br>end</pre>
        Here we have created our class Books, which requires two arguments upon creation.  It then sets instance variables
        those arguments equal to the supplied arguments.  To call an instance of our new class. type:
        <pre>first_book = Books.new("Ulysses", "James Joyce")</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        Our class doesn't do much right now, so let's add some more to it! Instance variables are shared across the object,
        so let's create some methods to access their value so other methods can reference them as well. We'll do this with
        a rather simple method that looks like this:
        <pre>def title <br> @title<br>end<br><br>def author <br> @author <br>end</pre>
        Now whenever you call the method <code>title</code>, it will return <code>@title</code> and similarly for <code>
        author</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay, that's great but our class still doesn't do much.
        <pre>def info <br> puts title + "," + author <br>end</pre>
        Now we can call our <code>info</code> on a class we've created and it will print out the title and author
        <pre>first_book.info</pre>
        Like instance variables, these are instance methods.  They are available to the entire instance
        of this particular class. As you can imagine we could create more methods to add more information to our class 
        like publisher, copyright date, plot, etc.
