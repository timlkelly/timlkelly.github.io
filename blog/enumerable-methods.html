      <h2>Enumerable Methods: Map</h2>
      1.10.2016
      <p>
        Enumerable methods allow for some very cool and useful data collection and sorting.  The built in
        Map method is similar to each but acts differently in how it returns data.  Map is a method that returns
        an array similar in size of what it was used on.  The elements of this new array consist of the result
        of the code block that was called on the the original objects.  Like each, map will iterate through the supplied
        elements though returning an array.
      </p>
      <p>
        The each method is also be used to iterate through objects however it is different because it will return
        what occurred in the code block.  And while you could set up each to return an array of items it iterated through
        map is simply more efficient.
