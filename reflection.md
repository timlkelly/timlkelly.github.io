# What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

This challenge helped strengthen my knowledge of padding, borders, and margins with boxes in CSS.  I often would use CSS to put a border around elements to get a better visual representation. In certain cases I've left that border property in the CSS file and just commented it out so that I can return to it when needed.  One thing that stumped me while working on my site is in regards to margins at the top of the page.  I had difficultly adjusting my top margin for the first element.  No matter what I put in, it wouldn't move.

# What did you learn about CSS positioning?

While I did not have much difficulty with positioning in this challenge, it is still a topic that I don't feel completely comfortable with just yet.  I used both relative and absolute positioning to move my elements around the page.

# What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

The positioning is really want stands out to me still as difficult.  Selecting fonts, color, size, etc, is fairly straight forward.  Additionally I need to revisit inheritance and the cascading aspects of CSS to further strengthen my knowledge in that area.  

# What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

It became clear that you need to give yourself a good working outline before you begin a project so you aren't backtracking.  I realized that you have to write your HTML code with CSS in mind.  Obviously you don't want to format in the HTML file but you want to give yourself enough selectors to use so you do not have to go back re-write the HTML to fit the CSS. Having the big picture in mind keeps you from having to backtracking, which in my case in a pervious assignment lead to more cluttered code.
