      future

      
      Native to the Chicago area, Tim grew up just outside the city in Evanston. Allured by the captivative 
      qualities of photography at a younger age he attended DePaul University in Chicago to study Digital Cinema 
      and Photography.  While there he took advantage of an opportunity to intern at a video production
      company in London, UK, who focused in the energy sector.  

      During an internship at a video production house in London, he witnessed a business
      for a niche market on a global scale. 

      Followed by a spell in Chicago's flourishing and prominent restaurant and bar scene. 
      Developing an appreciation for spirits, cocktails, and hospitality during his 
      tenure at The Aviary where he expedited in the kitchen. Time later spent at the Publican furthering
      beverage and food knowledge. A homebrewer himself, the beer focused menu at Publican was always inspiring.

        

        After what felt like a decade in Chicago's west Loop 


       In 2016 he will begin a new course of focus towards computer programing.
